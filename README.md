# Simple-C-Game-Wizard-Archer-and-Knight
Developed during the fourth quarter of 2019. A simple computer game code with basic graphics that I developed during the first few months of my software development journey. The game can be played either in PvP (Player vs. Player) or PvE (Player vs. Environment) mode on a computer. In the game, you have the choice of playing as a Wizard, an Archer, or a Knight, and you can engage in battles against other players or AI opponents. The game incorporates random processes to simulate various fighting environments. If it was developed using an object-oriented programming language, the codebase is quite extensive, comprising 7,071 lines of code.
